        <!-- The borders="1" will add a default border around the table and each cell
                This is a known error, you can use this on your tables until we get to css-->
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <!-- The thead will indicate a line for column headers. The cell tag for this line will be <th>. The contents of the cell will be bolded by default
                    
                Optionally: one can have their head titles on their rows. Here the developer uses the 1st column (general) as the titles for the data.
                If you are designing your table in this fashion then a thead area is not needed and the 1st cell on your tbody row will be a <th> cell.

                The text will not have any styling on default .
                See above for using <th> cell if you wish your headings to appear on the row instead of the column top.
                    
                By defauly, you are expected to have one <td> cell for each <th> cell.
                    
                <td> cells are grouped under a <tr> set of tags. <tr> is a table row. <td> is a data cell.
