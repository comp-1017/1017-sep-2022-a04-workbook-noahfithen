            if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag)
            you would be in trouble using the tag. instead: you can use special

    <h3> Anchor tag (a.k.a. linking to another page) </h3>
    <!-- blocked paired
        This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag
        One should NOT use the link tag because there is actually a <link> used in the <head> section
        The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it be on a different website,
        different page in the current website or a different location on the current page

        parameter:
        href: points to the desired location
        target: indicates the browser page display option
                default is same display page tab
                _blank will open a new browser tab (page)
    -->
    <a href="https://www.nait.ca" target="_blank"> go to NAIT </a>

    <h3> Image tag </h3>
    <!-- an empty tag (void) tag
        image tag does not have a closing tag
        the image tag has no content, however it does have parameters 
    
        parameters
        src="relative web site location"
        alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
        [title="tool tip text for the image"]

        Absolute Addressing is a complete fixed file path
            drive:/folder/.../folder/filename.ext

        Relative address begins at a specific point
        for websites, it is the "top if the website"
        reference to the desired filname is done by specifying the appropriate folder path
            to the desired file
        NO DRIVE

        Movement with a relative address
        - if only the file name is given, the location is within the same folder
        - movement down the file structure is by /foldername
        - movement up the file structure is by using .. for each folder level to ascend

        Same folder 
            ="filename.ext"

        Lower folder
            ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"

        From one lower folder to another lower folder on a different branch
        .. for each level that needs to be ascended
            ="../../../nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"
