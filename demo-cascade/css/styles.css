Classes

syntax for nameing is .user-name{rule}
you are not using element names
user name must be meaningful
classes can be attached to any element
classes are independent of an element
on html page to use: class="user-name [user-name]"

types: user (targetted) class
       psuedo class, these are attach to elements
        
anchor tag has several psuedo classes
NOTE! the order in which you code your psuedo classes for the anchor is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

a:link unused link
a:hover used when your cursor hovers over the anchor tag link
a:visited used when the anchor tag link has been clicked on previously
a:active used when you are actually clicking the anchor tag link
*/

nav ul li a:hover{
    color: blue;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: larger;
}
nav ul li a:active{
    color: red;
}

.bulletremoval{
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0px;
}

/* targetted class
   element.classname
*/ 
nav ul.bulletremoval{
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 10px;
}

/* id selector

similar to a class selector BUT is supposed to be used only once on a page whereas a class may be used multiple times

syntax #user-name{rules}
on the html page: id="user-name"
